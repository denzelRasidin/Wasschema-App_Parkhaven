This folder contains features that are independent from the other features.
You could remove or add a feature, and the app should still work.

In this app all these features are displayed via the router-outlet inside the dashboard component.


Technical:
Each feature can import stuff from the core and shared modules. Never the other way around!
These features can be lazily loaded.
