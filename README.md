# Wasschema2 - Angular

## Used:
- Angular
- Firebase (auth + rtdb)
- JWT/OAuth
- PWA

# Retrospective:
Angular Material is irritating to work with.
- Angular CLI compiles on changes even though I'm still typing
- I can't easily use Material to give child elements style. eg: I cant add margin 
  on mat-checkbox because the label is the actual element, and that is from a 
  different component. Styles don't leak so that I need to use ::ng-deep.
-  


I will not use retype password or are you sure modals.

- I did not make use of HammerJS for the swipe 
  functionality for the sidenav

# How to run
